# Business Statistics and Analysis Capstone (Rice University)

About this Course


The Business Statistics and Analysis Capstone is an opportunity to apply various skills developed across the four courses in the specialization to a real life data. The Capstone, in collaboration with an industry partner uses publicly available ‘Housing Data’ to pose various questions typically a client would pose to a data analyst.

Your job is to do the relevant statistical analysis and report your findings in response to the questions in a way that anyone can understand.
Please remember that this is a Capstone, and has a degree of difficulty/ambiguity higher than the previous four courses. The aim being to mimic a real life application as close as possible.
